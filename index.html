    <p>Hi! My name is Nick Miner and this is my page. Born in Dayton, Ohio, I served as a Sergeant in the USMC, earned a BS degree from The Ohio State University and attended a Full-Stack Development bootcamp for software development. I live with my girlfriend, our dog and cat; and I try to keep my personal interests as varied as my professional ones. I enjoy building PC's, rock climbing and learning new programming languages!
