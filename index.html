        <h1>Nicholas J. Miner</h1>
        <div class="center">
          <p id="text"> Life is better with balance. By combining Data Science and Software Development I push
            boundaries in multiple languages for increased modeling and computational efficiency. In mixing
            traditional leadership techniques with experimentalism I build team camaraderie focused on continuous
            efficiency.
            Visiting over a dozen countries on 4 continents and practiced polymathism give me a unique, forward-thinking
            perspective. My name is Nick Miner, and I'm here to fight for a better
            future. </p>
