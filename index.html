          <p id="text"> Life is better with balance. By combining Data Science and Software Development I push 
            boundaries in multiple languages for increased modeling and computational efficiency. In mixing 
            traditional &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leadership techniques with experimentalism 
            I build team &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; camaraderie 
            focused on continuous efficiency. Visiting over a dozen countries on 4 continents and practiced polymathism 
            give me a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unique, forward-thinking perspective. My name is Nick Miner, and &nbsp; 
            &nbsp;I'm here to fight for a better future. </p>
