                <p class="ed-textBlock"> Virtual Reality (VR) is a fully immersive simulated experience that can simulate fantasy or the real
                    world.
                    From creating 3D scatterplots to building room-scale simulated experiences, VR development has been
                    driven in Unity 3D with scripting in C#.

                    simultaneously provide continuous delivery.
                    Rigorous practice with version control through Git, virtualization and automation using Docker, and
                    all-level regression VR testing are just some
                    of the DevOps practices performed.

                    by upgrading existing hardware. Multiple powerful
                    machines have been designed and built for advanced VR development and heavy processing. Use of cloud

                    resources in both professional and personal development a regular occurence.

                    such as Lambda, Gateway, API and even IoT have provided a thorough entrance into horizontal scaling.
